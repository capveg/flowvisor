CODE LAYOUT:

All of the per-message processing logic is in 
    org.flowvisor.messages.*


THREAD MODEL:

FlowVisor has very little inter-thread interaction
and consequently very little locking.  Threads send
events to each other with the following logic.

All FVEventHandlers support handleEvent().  This event
first looks at the thread ID of the calling thread
and compares it to the thread ID of the EventHandler.
If they match, the event is processed immediately, and
if not, then the event is queued into the handler's
event loop.  There is no shared state between event handlers,
only copies of state and events to update the copies when
they become stale.
