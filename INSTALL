REQUIREMENTS:
    - ant           (no version requirements?)
    - java 1.6	    (currently works with both Sun's JDK; 
                     and OpenJDK)

BUILD:
    - run `make` (or `ant` : Makefile is just a wrapper)

    if you have problems finding jni.h, use:
	make CFLAGS=-I/path/to/javahome/include
    or just install libgcj-devel (jni.h versions are similar). For
    many linux systems, the following seems to be the right invocation:
	make CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include"

INSTALL:
    - make install

    This puts scripts and jars into a specified $prefix

CONFIG:
    Build a default configuration with:
    fvconfig generate <config.xml>

    List the contents of the config.xml:
    fvconfig dump <config.xml>

    The best way to edit the config is to run flowvisor (below)
    and use fvctl to to issue commands to the running flowvisor.

RUN: 
    To run flowvisor:
        flowvisor config.xml

        or link the /etc/init.d/flowvisor script into your 
        systems startup.

    To configure running flowvisor, use ./scripts/fvctl.sh
        `man 1 fvctl` or `man ./doc/fvctl.1` for details

PROBLEMS:

If you see this compile error, then you need to update your JVM:

compile:
