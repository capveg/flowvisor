REQUIREMENTS:
    - ant           (no version requirements?)
    - java 1.6	    (currently requires Sun's JDK)

BUILD:
    - run `make` (or `ant` : Makefile is just a wrapper)

INSTALL:
    - make install

    This puts scripts and jars into a specified $prefix

CONFIG:
    Build a default configuration with:
    ./scripts/config-gen-default.sh <config.xml>

    List the contents of the config.xml:
    ./scripts/config-dump.sh <config.xml>

    The best way to edit the config is to run flowvisor (below)
    and use fvctl to to issue commands to the running flowvisor.

RUN: 
    To run flowvisor:
        ./scripts/flowvisor.sh config.xml

    To configure running flowvisor, use ./scripts/fvctl.sh
        `man 1 fvctl` or `man ./doc/fvctl.1` for details
