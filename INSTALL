To build, need openflowj:
    (in some other dir)
    git clone git://openflowswitch.org/openflowj.git
    cd openflowj
    ant     # to build; see openflowj instructions for full details
Need to edit scripts/envs.sh to install dir (FIXME!)
Need to create SSL and FlowVisor configs:
    use ./scripts/config-gen-default.sh

To run flowvisor:
    scripts/flowvisor.sh
