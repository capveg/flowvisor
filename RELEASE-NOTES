FlowVisor 0.7 : 
    * fixed big I/O bug that caused switch flapping
    * added msg statistics, see `fvctl get{Slice,Switch}stats`
    * added flow tracking, see `fvctl get{Switch,SliceRewrite}FlowDB`
        to enable, run `fvctl setConfig flowvisor\!track_flows true`
    * lots of performance improvements
        * flow setup time ~5x improved
    * lots of small bugs fixed
    * password prompt no longer echos plaintext
    * better error handling in create slice and change flowspace
FlowVisor 0.6 - total rewrite (in Java!)
    * Single, unified flowspace config, not divided by slice
    * lldp is now rewritten with a trailer, not by rewritting the dst mac
    * OFError msgs now correctly encap the offending packet
    * NEW FlowVisor UserAPI: query and manipulate slice info
