fix spacing in OFMatch.tostring
verify that wildcards are getting set correctly in intersect
    - at each test?
    - at the end?




LONGER TERM:
- remove Slicable/Classifiable from msgs that don't need them
    replace with "if not instanceof Slicable, then warn and drop"
- move Statistics into OFMessage class hierarchy
