FlowVisor regression testing:




Using FlowVisor's Test Suite:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
FlowVisor ships with its own regression test suite:

To us it, run `./tests.sh` out of this directory after you've built
	the FlowVisor.   IF you run ./tests.sh with an extra arg, it will
	pause after the FlowVisor starts, but before the tests start.
	This is very useful when you would like to attach a debugger via
	`gdb flowvisor <pid>`

NOTES:
1) The above script runs all tests.  Individual tests can be run as
	`./tests-$type.py`
2) By default, the tests run with valgrind.  Unfortunately, you currently
	have to hand inspect valgrind.out after each test to verify
	nothing bad is happenning.






Using OpenFlow's Test Suite:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part of the regression test involves re-using regression tests from the
reference openflow implementation.  One can accomplish this as follows:

cd $FlowVisor/regress/bin
. env.sh
cd $openflow/regress/bin
[re-run regression tests; specifically the learning_switch ones]

This adds $FlowVisor/regress/bin to your path *ahead* of the openflow
binaries, so that the "controller" wrapper is from $FlowVisor/regress/bin
and not the standard binary.  Then all of the learning_switch examples
should pass the openflow tests with the FlowVisor acting as a proxy.
